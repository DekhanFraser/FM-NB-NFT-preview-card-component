## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt to use hover states and resolved my biggest issue - the hover overlay for the image with the icon. I still have things to improve, however, it was useful to keep building these cards. I am becoming faster at this.

Also, I made my own little CSS ultility class that I now add to each project before I start work. This class adds the dsign iimge as trannparrent erlay onto the page   alommetreach greatccuracy in reproducing the design.

### Continued development

I need to find better ways to produce image hover effects. I also need to work on my CSS structure as I feel that my CSS file is a bit bloated.
